Motivation
My motivation came from wanting to build an application for additional practice on my coding journey and to show employers what I can do. I have seen a lot of program out there. I must say, they are very intimidating and complex looking. I wanted something I could whip up in a moment to refer back to for basic JAVA concepts. Futhermore, I am doing my best to stay away from tutorial hell. As I understand to become a decent programmer, one must be independant, creative, and unaffraid of challenges. The more I was in the state of not knowing where to start, The better I wanted to become at this programming "thng". As a side note, I am going through a career change into the tech industry. The only to get there is to ACUALLY DO THE WORK... 

Why did you build this project?
After a long time of not using some online accounts of, I will either forget what my password was. Or, I will use the same password accross different websites. This is not good because it makes it very easy for data and information to be leacked. I built this projet because I wanted to create a way to instantly come up with new passwords when I cannot think of any myself. Furthermore, so I have less chances of comprimised data. 

What problem does it solve?
This solves the problem of having to think of a secure password on one's own. 

What did you learn?
In this bite seized application, I learned about how to implement scanners, learned more about the differents libraries JAVA has, appending information to output, and how to use Junit testing more effectivly.
