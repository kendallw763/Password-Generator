MOTIVATION

My motivation came from wanting to build an application for additional practice on my coding journey and to show employers what I can do. I wanted something I could whip up in a moment to refer back to for basic JAVA concepts. 

WHY WAS THIS BUILT AND WHAT DOES IT SOLVE?

After a long time of account inactivity, I will forget what my password was. I built this projet because I wanted to create a way to instantly come up with new passwords when I cannot think of any myself. This solves the problem of having to think of a secure password on one's own. 

WHAT I LEARNED.

In this bite seized application, I learned about how to implement scanners, learned more about the differents libraries JAVA has, such as secure random, appending information to the output, and how to use Junit testing more effectivly.
